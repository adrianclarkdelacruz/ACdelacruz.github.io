								<p class="entry"> This dashboard was created in order to demonstrate my skills in data analysis using call center data. The goal was to showcase 
									my ability to provide valuable insights for informed decision-making by policy/decision-makers within call center companies.
								</p>
								<p class="entry">
									The data set used for this dashboard was sourced from Enterprise DNA and the challenged was to create a report that met the specific requirements 
									of EDNA's Call Centers. The resulting dashboard shall provide valuable insights to call center companies, to help them optimize their operations 
									and improve customer satisfaction.
								</p>
								<p class="entry">
									By meeting the requirements of EDNA's Call Centers, I was able to create a report that accurately explains critical issues that need to be 
									addressed in order to continuously improve company performance. This demonstrates my ability to create informative and actionable reports that 
									can drive positive change within call center organizations.
								</p>

								<h1 style="font-size: 1.5em;color:#425664">Dataset</h1>
								<p class="entry"> 
									The data set used for this dashboard was sourced from Enterprise DNA and included call center data from EDNA's Call Centers spanning from 2018 to 
									2021. The dataset consisted of over 100,000 rows of data and was used to create a report that met the specific requirements of EDNA's Call Centers.
								</p>
								<p class="entry"> 
									As part of those requirements, a column named "Call Abandoned" was deleted from the Calls data files, and a new column called "SLA Compliance" was 
									created. This new column included a logical statement that determined whether a call was answered within the Service Level Agreement (SLA) or not, 
									and the results were shown as "Within SLA" or "Outside SLA."
								</p>  
								<br>

								<h1 style="font-size: 1.5em;color:#425664">Model Diagram</h1>
								<p class="entry"> 
									To design our data model, we utilized the Star Schema model and designated the Call Logs table as the Fact table, along with the Call Charge, Date, 
									and Employees tables as the Dimension tables. The Fact and Dimension tables were linked using a One-to-Many Relationship based on common key fields. 
									Overall, this model enabled us to generate actionable insights that could be used to improve the performance of call center companies.</p>
